      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! I'm fairly new to web development, but am very eager to learn all I can in the upcoming six month boot-camp!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up on a small family farm in the state of Iowa, but I relocated to Orlando Florida about half a year ago with my family.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy watching TV shows on various streaming services that include:
        <li>Supernatural</li>
        <li>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</li>
        <li>Naruto Shippuden</li>
<p></p>
      I also enjoy reading books by the author Brandon Sanderson:
      <li>Mistborn Trilogy</li>
      <li>The Way of Kings Series</li>
      <li>Warbreaker</li>
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I feel most comfortable being out in nature with the wind in my hair and the sun on my skin.
        I had considered becoming a Park Ranger, but I would miss interacting with people. I don't think that
        the perfect job is out there for me, but I have a passion for learning new things and I'm not afraid to ask questions 
        or find things out on my own!
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Orlando, Florida</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I took a computer programming class in high school and honestly I was <strong>terrible</strong> at it, 
        but I never forgot how coding made me feel. I can't honestly remember the language, but it was 
      incredibly satisfying to create something completely new from a whole page of code and debug issues!</p>
